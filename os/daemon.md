## The Golden Circle

### WHY
Transform lives through source-born mastery. Every decision filters through: *Does this enable deeper transformation at the source?*

### HOW
- Manual before automated
- Quality before scale
- Community before content
- Source before simulation

### WHAT
Real certifications (PADI, RYA, Yoga Alliance, WSET) + Lifelong community (8-12 person cohorts) + Premium destinations worldwide.

## Core Principles

### 1. The Drucker Discipline
*"There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all."*

Before any initiative:
- Does this directly serve learner transformation?
- Would I be proud to explain this to our first cohort?
- Can we execute this manually before building systems?

### 2. The Buffett Filter
*"Really successful people say no to almost everything."*

**NO to:**
- Partnership requests before pilot validation
- Tech investments before manual process proof
- Geographic expansion before single-location mastery
- Any "optimization" that dilutes the core experience

**YES to:**
- Direct customer conversations
- Instructor relationship building
- Venue quality verification
- Cohort experience observation

### 3. The Jobs Standard
*"People don't know what they want until you show them."*

Create experiences so remarkable they become stories people tell. Design for the transformation, not the transaction.

### 4. The 10/10/10 Rule
Before major decisions:
- How will I feel about this in 10 minutes?
- How will I feel about this in 10 months?
- How will I feel about this in 10 years?

Short-term revenue never trumps long-term reputation.

## The Mission Drift Test

Before approving any new initiative:

```
1. Does this serve transformation through source immersion?
   → NO: Reject immediately

2. Can we execute this manually first?
   → NO: Defer until post-pilot

3. Does this strengthen cohort bonds?
   → NO: Question necessity

4. Would our best instructor endorse this?
   → NO: Reconsider approach
```

## Brand Voice

**Use:**
- "Skill adventures at the source"
- "One week to get certified. 6 months to change your life."
- "Choose your depth"
- "Certified" (not just "learning")
- "Cohort" (not "group" or "class")

**Avoid:**
- "Life-changing" (overused)
- "Journey" alone (too generic)
- "Escape" (implies running from)
- "Easy" or "effortless" (dishonest)
- "Luxury" (we're premium, not indulgent)

---

## The Oath

*I will protect the mission above my ego.*

*I will sell before I scale.*

*I will listen before I lecture.*

*I will choose transformation over transaction.*

*I will build a company that my first cohort would be proud to recommend.*
