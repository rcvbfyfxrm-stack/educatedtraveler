# EducatedTraveler Brand Guardrails

This document captures the core brand rules and ethics for EducatedTraveler. Treat this as a checklist for any new copy, UX, or product framing.

## 1. Spectrum, Not Random Durations
- Always use the official ladder:
  - 7–21 days → **Foundation (Get certified)**
  - 30–60 days → **Mastery (Go deeper)**
  - 90–180 days → **Saga (Change your life)**
- Do **not** invent extra durations (e.g. “2 years”, “several years”) that don’t match the product spectrum.

## 2. Lead With 7–21 Day Adventures
- Short immersions are the primary entry point.
- Longer options (1–3 months, 3–6 months) are framed as **deeper paths**, not the default.

## 3. Real Certifications, Not Vague Learning
- Anchor offerings on **recognized certifications** (PADI, RYA, Yoga Alliance, WSET, culinary credentials, etc.).
- Emphasize progression and standards, not just “experiences.”

## 4. Cohorts, Not Crowds
- Use the word **“cohort”** (not “group” or “class”).
- Respect size limits:
  - 8–12 max (6–8 for sailing)
- Avoid any language implying big tour groups or mass tourism.

## 5. Serious Training, Not Easy Hacks
- Never promise “easy” or “effortless” mastery.
- Make it clear these are **serious trainings** with real effort, standards, and accountability.

## 6. Time & Rest Non‑Negotiables
- Do not design or describe schedules that violate:
  - **≤ 90 minute sitting blocks**
  - **1 rest day per week minimum**
- If in doubt, bias toward more rest and integration time, not less.

## 7. Instructor Quality Is Sacred
- Instructors should be framed as:
  - **5+ years experience**
  - Properly **certified** in their discipline
- Never imply that casual or uncertified leaders are acceptable.

## 8. Voice & Words Discipline
- **Use:**
  - “**Skill adventures at the source**”
  - “**One week to get certified. 6 months to change your life.**”
  - “**Choose your depth**”
  - “**Certified**”
  - “**Cohort**”
- **Avoid:**
  - Generic “life‑changing” claims without context
  - Vague use of “journey”
  - “Luxury” (we are **premium**, not indulgent)
  - “Easy” or “effortless”

## 9. Premium, Not Indulgent
- Aesthetic and language should feel **cinematic, minimal, precise**.
- Think **Apple glass meets Netflix minimal**, not a discount travel agency or flashy luxury resort.

## 10. Respect the Source & the Student
- Emphasize learning **at the source with respect** for local culture, environment, and people.
- Avoid extractive or exploitative framing.
- Honor the effort and commitment students bring; do not trivialize their work.
