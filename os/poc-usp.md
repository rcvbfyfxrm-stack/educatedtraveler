## Proof of Concept (POC)

### The Hypothesis

```
People will pay premium prices ($3,500-$12,000+) for certified
skill immersions at the source, taught by masters, in small cohorts.
```

### What We Must Prove

| Question | Validation Method | Success Metric |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Will people pay?** | Paid deposits before building | 10 deposits @ $500+ |
| **Will they complete?** | First cohort completion | 95%+ finish rate |
| **Will they transform?** | Post-experience surveys | NPS 70+ |
| **Will they refer?** | Organic referrals tracked | 3+ referrals per cohort |
| **Will instructors commit?** | LOIs from masters | 3 signed LOIs |
| **Does unit economics work?** | First cohort P&L | 30%+ gross margin |

### POC Phases
