## *The People and Places That Taught Me*

## The Short Version (50 words)

I left France at 18 to learn by doing. 50,000+ nautical miles sailed—taught by captains who became mentors. Kitchens on three continents—guided by chefs who shared everything. Trails, oceans, markets, ashrams. The people I met along the way shaped who I am. EducatedTraveler exists to create those connections for others.

---

## The Medium Version (150 words)

At 18, I got my Bac in science and left France. Not because I had answers—because I had questions that classrooms couldn't touch.

What followed wasn't a solo journey. It was a decade of being taught by remarkable people. Captains who trusted me with night watches and showed me how to read the sea. Chefs who let me into their kitchens and shared techniques passed down through generations. Freedivers who taught me that the ocean reveals who you are. Trekkers on Himalayan trails who knew plants, paths, and patience I'd never find in books.

I sailed 50,000+ miles because people believed in me before I believed in myself. I cooked on superyachts because mentors opened doors. Every skill I have came from someone generous enough to teach me.

EducatedTraveler connects those teachers with those ready to learn. That's all it is.

## The Full Story

### I. The Departure

```
At 18, I got my Bac in science.
Then I did something my classmates didn't understand.

I left.
```

Not because I was special. Because I was restless. Traditional academia felt like watching life through a window. I wanted to be in it.

Australia was the first stop. I showed up with not much more than curiosity and willingness to work. I found kitchens that would have me, and I started cooking—badly at first, then less badly, then with something resembling competence.

What I didn't expect: the people. Chefs who had no reason to teach me but did anyway. Travelers who shared roads and stories. Locals who showed me their country through their eyes, not a guidebook.

That first year taught me something I've never forgotten: **the best teachers aren't in institutions. They're in the world, doing the work, willing to share if you're willing to listen.**

---

### II. The Kitchens

I didn't set out to become a chef. I set out to eat, and cooking was how I could afford to.

But kitchens became classrooms.

**France**: I was lucky enough to train under chefs who had spent their lives perfecting their craft. They were demanding—sometimes brutally so—but they shared everything. Not just recipes. Philosophy. Standards. The understanding that food carries culture, history, memory.

**Southeast Asia**: The real education happened in markets and street stalls. A grandmother in Bangkok who let me watch her make pad thai the same way she'd made it for 40 years. A pho vendor in Vietnam who explained that the broth was her grandmother's recipe, simmered the same way for three generations. They didn't have to share. They chose to.

**The Superyachts**: Working as a chef on luxury vessels taught me precision under pressure. But more than that, it taught me sourcing—showing up at dawn in Provençal markets, learning which fisherman to trust in Greek harbors, understanding that ingredients have stories.

Every kitchen I entered, someone took the time to teach me. I was the student far more often than the expert. That never changed.

---

### III. The Wine

I got my WSET certification in Paris. The classroom gave me vocabulary, structure, theory.

But where I really learned wine was different.

For a month, I cycled through the vineyards of the South of France. Village to village. Winemaker to winemaker. Tasting rooms where the person pouring was the person who grew the grapes, crushed them, waited years for the result.

They told me about soil and sun and generations of family knowledge. They let me taste wines that never left the region. They explained why this hill produced something different than the hill across the road.

No certification teaches that. Only the source does. Only the people who live it.

---

### IV. The Ocean

Sailing started with a dream—the kind you get from reading navigator books, imagining yourself at the helm crossing oceans.

But the dream became real in Sydney.

I crewed on a regatta sailboat in the bay, and the moment I stepped on that deck, everything changed. The heel of the boat. The coordination of the crew. The way the wind wasn't an obstacle but a language you could learn to speak.

I wanted more.

I earned my RYA Day Skipper in Thailand—where warm water and steady winds made learning feel like living. Then I joined my first long-passage sailboat at 22. The owner was also the captain, the engineer, the navigator. He did everything, and he taught me while he did it.

**That man changed my life.** Not through formal instruction. Through patience, trust, and letting me make mistakes when the stakes were low so I wouldn't make them when the stakes were high.

What followed:

- **50,000+ nautical miles** across the Mediterranean, Atlantic, Pacific, and Thailand's waters
- **Blue-water racing** where I learned that teamwork under pressure reveals character
- **Night watches** where senior sailors taught me to read stars and swells
- **Passages** where the only teacher was the sea itself

Every captain I sailed with gave me something. A technique. A story. A way of seeing. I collected mentors the way some people collect stamps.

---

### V. The Depths

Freediving found me in Thailand and Indonesia.

The instructors weren't just teaching breath-holding. They were teaching presence. The ability to be completely where you are—not thinking about the surface, not thinking about depth, just being in the moment between breaths.

In the Galápagos, I dove with sharks. Not in a cage. In open water, guided by people who had spent years understanding these animals. They taught me that fear is information, and respect is the only real protection.

Every dive instructor I trained with shared something beyond technique. They shared relationship—with the water, with breath, with the creatures we visited.

---

### VI. The Mountains

The Himalayas humbled me.

Weeks of trekking to Annapurna Base Camp. 4,130 meters. Thin air and thick gratitude.

But the mountain wasn't the teacher. The people were.

On India's roads, I met a photographer who stopped for anyone willing to learn about light. On the trails, hikers who knew every plant, every shortcut, every story of the villages we passed. In ashrams, teachers who had renounced everything except the willingness to share what they'd learned.

India especially marked me. The spirituality wasn't performance—it was life. The human contact was unhurried, real. People took time. They asked questions. They listened to answers.

I traveled all over: the chaos of Delhi, the ghats of Varanasi, the backwaters of Kerala, the mountains of Ladakh. Each place, someone taught me something I couldn't have learned anywhere else.

---

### VII. The Pattern

Somewhere in all those miles, I noticed something.

Every skill I valued—sailing, cooking, diving, wine—had come the same way:

**From a person. At a place. Through generous teaching.**

Not from courses I took alone. Not from videos I watched at 2 AM. From human beings who knew something deeply and chose to share it.

The captains who let me helm through the night. The chefs who showed me their mother's recipe. The freedivers who taught me to trust my breath. The winemakers who poured from bottles they'd never sell.

These connections made me who I am.

And I realized: **most people never get them.** Not because they don't want to learn—because the logistics are impossible. The masters don't advertise. The paths aren't marked. The friction stops people before they start.

---

### VIII. Why EducatedTraveler Exists

I built EducatedTraveler to create the connections I was lucky enough to find.

That's all it is.

**The masters**: People who've spent decades perfecting their craft and want to pass it on. I know how rare and generous that is. I've been the beneficiary my whole adult life.

**The places**: Where the knowledge lives. Tokyo fish markets. Rishikesh ashrams. Atlantic passages. South of France vineyards. You can't learn these things in a simulation. You have to go there.

**The cohorts**: 8-12 people who become connected through shared challenge. The way I connected with crews, with fellow travelers, with kitchen teams. Those bonds last.

**The certifications**: PADI, RYA, Yoga Alliance, WSET—real credentials that open doors. Because I know what it means to have proof of what you've learned.

I'm not offering something I invented. I'm offering what I received—structured so others don't need a decade of lucky breaks to find it.

---

### IX. What I Believe

I don't think I'm special. I think I was fortunate.

Fortunate that people taught me. Fortunate that I said yes when opportunities appeared. Fortunate that the world is full of generous experts if you know where to look.

EducatedTraveler is my way of making that fortune accessible.

**Source before simulation.** Not because it sounds good—because it's true. The places where skills were born hold something that can't be exported.

**Masters before influencers.** Decades of expertise over thousands of followers. The people who taught me didn't have Instagram accounts. They had calluses and patience.

**Cohorts before crowds.** Small groups who become connected. The way every meaningful relationship I formed happened—through shared experience, not shared content.

---

### X. The Invitation

The people who taught me didn't ask for anything in return.

But they gave me a debt I can only repay forward.

If you're ready to learn something real—not watch it, not read about it, actually learn it—EducatedTraveler is the bridge.

I can't give you my journey. But I can connect you with the same kind of teachers who shaped mine.

From the people who taught me, to the people you'll learn from.

That's the thread.

**Skills last, tans fade.**
