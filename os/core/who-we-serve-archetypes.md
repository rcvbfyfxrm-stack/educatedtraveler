# Who We Serve – Learner Archetypes

Short profiles of the ideal EducatedTraveler learners. Use these when writing copy, designing programs, or choosing partners.

## 1. The Burned-Out Professional Seeking Real Skill
- **Before**: Corporate or consulting job, successful on paper but craving something real and embodied.
- **After**: Certified in a skill at the source (e.g., PADI, RYA, culinary), with a tangible path to integrate it into life or career.
- **Cares About**: Credible certifications, serious instruction, clear progression.
- **Not**: A party tourist or someone looking for an all-inclusive resort.

## 2. The Emerging Professional Leveling Up
- **Before**: Already in the field (chef, yoga teacher, sommelier, etc.), plateaued at the current level.
- **After**: Deeper certification or advanced credential that unlocks new roles or higher-end work.
- **Cares About**: Master instructors, rigorous standards, being challenged.
- **Not**: A beginner dabbling for fun.

## 3. The Career Switcher
- **Before**: 5–15 years in one career, now ready to pivot into something more meaningful.
- **After**: Foundation or Mastery level certification plus a clear sense of what a new path could look like.
- **Cares About**: Clarity of next steps, honest expectations, cohort support.
- **Not**: Someone expecting instant overnight transformation.

## 4. The Deep Enthusiast
- **Before**: Already obsessed with a skill (sailing, diving, sushi, yoga), mostly self-taught or hobby-level.
- **After**: Formal certification and time at the source that turns “hobby” into “serious craft.”
- **Cares About**: Authenticity of place, time with masters, behind-the-scenes access.
- **Not**: Chasing social media content or clout.

## 5. The Sabbatical Seeker
- **Before**: Taking 1–6 months off (between jobs, post-exit, post-burnout), open to deep work.
- **After**: One or more stacked programs (Foundation → Mastery → Saga) with real credentials and a new community.
- **Cares About**: Depth, structure, and meaning—not just rest.
- **Not**: A backpacker hopping between parties.
