# Brand Drift Triggers

Early warning signs that we are drifting away from the EducatedTraveler core. Review these quarterly.

## Language Drift
- Phrases like **"package", "tour", "luxury escape"** start appearing in copy.
- We stop emphasizing **certification** and start emphasizing “vibes” or generic “experiences.”
- "Easy" and "effortless" show up in headlines about serious skills.

## Product Drift
- Cohort sizes start creeping above **12** (or above **8** for sailing) “just this once.”
- Rest days are removed or shortened to “fit in more activities.”
- Non-certified “add-on experiences” become a bigger focus than the core certification.

## Partner Drift
- We say yes to partners primarily for **reach or money**, not alignment.
- Venues pressure us to increase headcount or reduce standards.

## Operational Drift
- Scorecards (`os/core/program-quality-scorecard.md`) are skipped or filled out superficially.
- We expand to new locations before proving one location properly.

## Signal: Time to Audit

If **two or more** of these triggers show up in a quarter:
- Run a **Mission Drift Audit** using `os/daemon.md` and `os/brand/brand-guardrails.md`.
- Ask:
  - What decisions created this drift?
  - What do we need to stop, fix, or roll back?

**Prime Directive**: Protect the core even if it costs short-term revenue.
