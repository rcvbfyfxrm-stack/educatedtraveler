# Program Fit Checklist

Use this checklist before approving or launching any new EducatedTraveler program.

## 1. Duration & Depth
- [ ] Fits one of the official ladders:
  - [ ] 7–21 days → **Foundation (Get certified)**
  - [ ] 30–60 days → **Mastery (Go deeper)**
  - [ ] 90–180 days → **Saga (Change your life)**
- [ ] No invented, off-spectrum duration is being used as a primary offer.

## 2. Certification & Standards
- [ ] Leads to a **real certification** from a recognized body (PADI, RYA, Yoga Alliance, WSET, etc.).
- [ ] Certification requirements are clearly documented (hours, dives, sails, exams, assessments).
- [ ] Assessment is honest and cannot be “fudged” to pass everyone.

## 3. Cohort & Learning Design
- [ ] Cohort size respects non-negotiables:
  - [ ] 8–12 learners (6–8 for sailing) max.
- [ ] No sitting blocks > 90 minutes.
- [ ] At least 1 rest/integration day per week.

## 4. Instructor & Venue
- [ ] Lead instructor has **5+ years** relevant experience.
- [ ] Instructor holds the necessary certifications and/or lineage.
- [ ] Venue supports small cohorts and deep work (not mass tourism).

## 5. Transformation Statement
- Write this in one sentence:

> **Arrive as:** ____________________
>
> **Leave as:** ____________________

- [ ] This transformation is realistic, specific, and backed by the structure of the program.

## 6. Alignment With Daemon & Guardrails
- [ ] Program respects all non-negotiables in `os/daemon.md`.
- [ ] Program respects all brand rules in `os/brand/brand-guardrails.md`.

## 7. Go / No-Go
- [ ] All critical boxes above are checked.
- [ ] If any critical box is unchecked, there is a clear, time-bound plan to fix it **before** launch.

**Rule**: If this checklist cannot be completed with integrity, the program does **not** launch.
