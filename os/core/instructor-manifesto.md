# Instructor Manifesto & Minimum Standard

## Manifesto – Who We Invite to Teach

We work with **masters, not influencers**. EducatedTraveler instructors are:
- People who have dedicated **years or decades** to their craft.
- Guardians of a lineage or standard, not just performers of a skill.
- Committed to **rigor, safety, and transformation**, not entertainment.

### What We Expect
- You treat each cohort as if your **closest friend** were inside it.
- You care about **certification integrity**: nobody passes who shouldn’t.
- You respect **rest and human limits** as much as you respect hard work.
- You see learners as **future peers**, not customers.

### What We Reject
- Instructors whose primary value is social media reach.
- Anyone willing to compromise standards for speed or volume.
- Teaching that treats learners as spectators instead of practitioners.

## Minimum Standard

Every EducatedTraveler instructor must meet these minimums:

### Experience & Credentials
- **5+ years** of meaningful, relevant experience.
- Holding the **certifications required** to legally and ethically teach at the advertised level.
- A history of **successful student outcomes** (pass rates, referrals, returning students).

### Teaching & Safety
- Clear, structured teaching style (not just “watch me do it”).
- Commitment to safety protocols of their certifying body.
- Willingness to adapt to different learner levels inside a small cohort.

### Alignment With EducatedTraveler
- Resonates with the daemon (`os/daemon.md`) and brand guardrails.
- Agrees to:
  - Respect cohort size limits.
  - Honor rest days and 90-minute sitting block max.
  - Participate in post-cohort review and improvement.

## Instructor Fit Questions

Use these questions when evaluating a new instructor:
- What have you **dedicated your life** to mastering?
- How do you know when a student is **truly ready** to be certified?
- Tell us about a time you **failed a student** (or delayed their certification) for their own good.
- How do you balance **pushing** learners with keeping them **safe**?
- How do you want your students to feel **one year after** training with you?

If these answers do not reflect mastery, care, and integrity, we do not proceed.
