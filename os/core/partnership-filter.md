# Partnership Filter

Use this filter before saying yes to any partner: venues, certifying bodies, local operators, or brands.

## 1. Alignment With Source Philosophy
- [ ] Does this partner help us deliver **skills at the source**?
- [ ] Do they respect the **origin and lineage** of the craft?

If "no" here, stop.

## 2. Respect for Cohorts & Depth
- [ ] Can they support **small cohorts** (8–12, 6–8 for sailing) without pressure to scale up headcount?
- [ ] Are they comfortable with **rest days** and deep work over surface tourism?

## 3. Ethics & Local Impact
- [ ] Do they treat local staff, environment, and community well?
- [ ] Are we proud of how this partnership will be perceived by locals?

## 4. Financial Fit
- [ ] Is the partnership financially sustainable for both sides?
- [ ] Does it support our **premium, not luxury** positioning (not discount tourism, not exploitative pricing)?

## 5. Brand & Experience
- [ ] Would we be comfortable putting this partner on the homepage?
- [ ] Does their aesthetic and behavior match our **Apple glass meets Netflix minimal** ethos?

## Red Flags (Automatic No)

- Mass-tourism operations pushing large groups.
- Pressure to **cut rest**, pack itineraries, or dilute standards.
- Disregard for local community or environment.
- Using "luxury" as a primary hook in a way that conflicts with our mission.

**Rule**: A single serious red flag is enough to say **no**, even if the financials look good.
