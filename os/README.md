VIII. Masters, not influencers
IX.   Credentials that matter
X.    No mission drift
XI.   Metrics that matter
XII.  Build to last
```

**Type 2 (Reversible)**: Decide in <24h → Execute → Learn → Iterate

## The Prime Directive

```
Does this help someone master a real skill
at the source where it was born,
with a master who has dedicated their life to it,
surrounded by a cohort who will become lifelong friends?

YES → Do it.
NO  → Don't.
```
