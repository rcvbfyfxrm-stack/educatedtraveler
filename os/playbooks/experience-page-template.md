## 2. Opening Statement

A vivid, first-person scene that drops the reader into the experience. Use sensory details. Make them feel they're already there.

**Template:**
```
At [TIME], [SETTING DETAIL]. [SENSORY DETAIL - smell, sound, temperature].
[What you're doing in this moment]. This is where your transformation begins—
not as a [tourist/visitor], but as [new identity: an apprentice/a pilgrim/a sailor].
```

**Example (Sushi):**
> At 4:47 AM, while Tokyo still sleeps, you'll walk through the gates of Toyosu Market. The air is cold, sharp with the scent of the sea. This is where your transformation begins—not as a tourist, but as an apprentice to a craft perfected over centuries.

**Example (Sailing):**
> It's 3 AM. The North Star hangs above the bow. Your crew sleeps below as you helm through 15-foot swells, 200 miles from the nearest land. In this moment, you're not learning to sail—you're becoming a sailor.

intensity and exacting standards will push you beyond what you thought possible.

## 6. Places You'll Experience

4-6 specific locations with vivid descriptions:

```
[PLACE NAME]
[1-2 sentences: What you'll do there + why it matters + sensory/emotional detail]
```

**Examples:**
- **Toyosu Fish Market**: Daily 5AM visits. Watch the famous tuna auctions. Build relationships with vendors who've supplied Tokyo's best for generations.
- **Beatles Ashram**: Meditate where John, Paul, George, and Ringo wrote the White Album. Now reclaimed by the jungle—a spiritual time capsule.
- **Open Atlantic**: 600 nautical miles to Madeira. No land for 4 days. This is where sailors are made.

---

## 7. What You'll Master

4-6 specific skills with practical implications:

```
[SKILL NAME]
[What it is + why it matters + what you can do with it after]
```

**Example (Sailing):**
- **Celestial Navigation**: Navigate by sun, moon, and stars. When GPS fails 500 miles offshore, you'll know exactly where you are using a sextant and centuries-old mathematics.
- **Heavy Weather Sailing**: Reefing in 30 knots. Heaving-to in storms. You'll train for conditions you hope to never see—and know what to do if you do.
