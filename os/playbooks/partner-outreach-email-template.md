## Sample Email: Trafalgar Sailing (Gibraltar)

**To:** Jim @ Trafalgar Sailing
**Subject:** Partnership Inquiry — EducatedTraveler x Trafalgar Sailing

---

Jim,

**[PERSONALIZED OPENING]**

I've been following Trafalgar Sailing's work in Gibraltar—fast-track RYA programs crossing the Straits to Morocco aboard 50ft Jeanneaus, led by someone who raced J-Class (Velsheda) with Team New Zealand. That combination of America's Cup intensity and tidal passage expertise is exactly what produces real sailors, not just certificate holders.

**[WHO WE ARE]**

I'm Arnaud Callier, founder of EducatedTraveler. We're building a platform for certified skill immersions at the source—connecting serious students with master instructors worldwide. RYA in Gibraltar. Sushi mastery in Tokyo. Yoga certification in Rishikesh. Real credentials, real locations, real teachers.

**[WHY YOU]**

Gibraltar is one of the few places where students can experience genuine tidal challenges, international waters, and Mediterranean conditions in a single program. Your racing background adds something most schools can't offer: the instinct for reading conditions that only comes from competitive sailing at the highest level.

**[THE PROPOSAL]**

We'd like to explore featuring Trafalgar Sailing as our flagship RYA partner for the Gibraltar/Mediterranean region. What this means:

- **Curated Students**: We pre-qualify participants—serious learners, not tourists
- **Premium Positioning**: Featured placement for students seeking the best, not the cheapest
- **Full Logistics**: We handle travel, accommodation, transfers—you focus on teaching
- **Cohort Model**: 6-8 students per intake, committed for full program duration

**[EXPERIENCE ENHANCEMENTS — TAILORED TO TRAFALGAR]**

Based on your location and expertise, here are ideas to co-create an experience that becomes legendary:

**Leveraging Gibraltar's Unique Position:**
- **Straits Night Crossing**: Mandatory night passage through the Straits—shipping lanes, currents, lights. This is where sailors are made.
- **Morocco Landfall at Dawn**: Time the crossing for sunrise arrival in Tangier. First glimpse of Africa from the helm.
- **Rock Anchorage**: Anchor drill in the shadow of the Rock. Iconic backdrop, challenging conditions.
- **Atlantic vs. Med Transition**: Day sail from Med into Atlantic swells. Feel the ocean change beneath you.

**Leveraging Your Racing Background:**
- **Race Day Integration**: Enter students in local Gibraltar regatta or organize cohort race. Competition sharpens everything.
- **Tactical Debrief Sessions**: Apply J-Class tactical thinking to passage planning. Weather routing as strategy.
- **Crew Coordination Drills**: Racing-style communication and maneuvers. Precision matters.
- **Velsheda Stories Evening**: Share Team NZ experiences over dinner. Inspiration from the top.

**Making It Unforgettable:**
- **Captain's Dinner in Tangier**: Final night feast in Morocco. You started in Europe, you celebrate in Africa.
- **Straits Crossing Certificate**: Custom certificate for completing the crossing. Framed, meaningful.
- **Logbook Tradition**: Leather-bound personal logbook with Gibraltar stamps.
- **Alumni Burgee**: EducatedTraveler x Trafalgar burgee for graduates to fly.

**[CALL TO ACTION]**

Would you be open to a 20-minute call to explore this? I'm in [timezone] and flexible on timing.

No pressure, no obligation—just a conversation about whether this makes sense for both of us.

Fair winds,

P.S. — I've done 50,000+ miles myself, including Atlantic crossings. I know the difference between schools that produce sailors and those that produce certificates. Trafalgar produces sailors.

## More Sample Openers by Partner Type

### Culinary (Tokyo Sushi)

> Tanaka-san, I've read about your 30 years at Tsukiji and the 10-year rice apprenticeship philosophy. In a world of 6-week sushi "certifications," your insistence on fundamentals—knife work before fish, rice before knife—produces chefs who actually belong behind a counter.

**Tailored Enhancements:**
- 4AM Tsukiji auction access (before it's gone forever)
- Single-origin rice tasting (understand the foundation)
- Knife forging day trip to Sakai
- Tea ceremony integration (hospitality philosophy)
- Graduation omakase for invited guests

### Diving (Koh Tao PADI)

> Sarah, your Platinum Course Director status and 8,000+ logged dives speak for themselves—but what caught my attention is the conservation focus. Reef restoration isn't a marketing add-on for you; it's why you're still diving after 20 years.

**Tailored Enhancements:**
- Coral nursery adoption (students plant and track fragments)
- Whale shark research contribution (photo ID submissions)
- Night dive bioluminescence experience
- Technical diving introduction for advanced students
- Freediving crossover day (breath confidence)

### Yoga (Rishikesh Ashram)

> Swami Dev, your 45 years in the Sivananda lineage and the 4AM sadhana requirement tell me this isn't a yoga retreat—it's a yoga education. The Ganges ceremonies aren't tourism; they're transmission of a living tradition.

**Tailored Enhancements:**
- Personal mantra initiation (for committed students)
- Himalayan day trek to meditation caves
- Ayurvedic consultation and diet integration
- Sanskrit study sessions (understand the chants)
- Service day at local school (karma yoga)
- Silence day with Ganges sunrise meditation

### Wine (Burgundy WSET)

> Marie, fourth-generation vigneronne and MW candidate—that combination of inherited terroir knowledge and formal wine education is rare. The cellar access at [producer] isn't something students can buy; it's something they have to earn.

**Tailored Enhancements:**
- Harvest day participation (pick grapes, feel the vintage)
- Barrel room blending session (create personal cuvée)
- Vertical tasting spanning 20+ years
- Terroir walk through Côte d'Or (taste the soil differences)
- Winemaker dinner with off-list bottles
- Personal bottles to cellar and revisit in 10 years
