## Email 1: First Outreach (Warm, Curious)

**Subject Line Options:**
- "Your work resonated — wanted to share something"
- "A different kind of teaching opportunity"
- "Building something for instructors who believe in depth"

---

**Email Body:**

Hi [Name],

I came across your [specific content: post about teaching methodology / video on alignment / thoughts on what makes training transformational] and it stuck with me.

I'm working on something called EducatedTraveler and wanted to see if it might resonate with you.

The idea is simple: extended immersive programs (21 days to 6 months) where small groups earn real certifications while living at the source of their craft. Yoga in Bali. Sailing in Greece. That kind of thing.

We're building around three rhythms—adventure, immersion, and optimization—because we believe transformation needs all three: the body engaged, the mind focused, and enough space to actually absorb what's being learned.

We handle all the logistics. Instructors just teach.

I'm reaching out because the instructors we want to partner with are the ones who believe depth matters more than reach. Who'd rather work with 10 committed students than 100 casual ones.

If that sounds like you, I put together a page that explains more and has a simple form to connect:

No pressure at all. If it's not a fit, no worries. But if you've ever wished you had more time with students who actually want to go deep—might be worth a look.

Either way, keep doing what you're doing.

EducatedTraveler

P.S. — We're starting with a pilot cohort in 2026 and looking for 1-2 instructors to build with from the beginning.

## Email 2: Gentle Follow-Up (7 Days Later)

**Subject:** Following up (no pressure)

---

Hi [Name],

Just floating this back up in case it got buried—I know inboxes are relentless.

The short version: I'm building extended immersive programs (21+ days) where small groups learn at the source of their craft. Looking for instructors who believe depth matters.

If you're curious: [Link to instructors.html]

If not, totally fine. Either way, wishing you well.

## Email 3: If They're Not Available (Referral)

**Subject:** Thank you — and a quick question

---

Hi [Name],

Thanks for getting back to me. Completely understand that the timing isn't right.

Quick question: Do you know anyone who might be a good fit? We're looking for instructors who share that belief in going deep rather than wide.

No pressure at all. Just thought I'd ask.

Appreciate your time.

## Email 4: Personalized (For Instructors Whose Work Really Resonates)

**Subject:** Your post on [topic] made me want to reach out

---

Hi [Name],

I read your [post / watched your video] about [specific thing] and it really landed.

The part about [specific insight or philosophy]—that's exactly what we're trying to build at EducatedTraveler.

We're creating extended immersive programs where small groups (8-12 people) spend 21 days to 6 months learning at the source. Yoga in Bali. Sailing in Greece. Wine in Tuscany.

The idea is built around three rhythms: adventure, immersion, and optimization. Movement to open the body. Depth to develop the skill. Space to absorb without burning out.

We handle all the logistics—venue, transport, meals, paperwork. Instructors just teach.

I'm not trying to pitch you. I'm trying to find people who believe the same things we do about what makes learning transformational. Your work suggests you might.

If you're curious: [Link to instructors.html]

No pressure. Just wanted to connect.
