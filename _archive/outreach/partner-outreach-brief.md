**WHAT we deliver**:
- Certified skill adventures from 7 days to 6 months
- Small cohorts (8-12) of committed, qualified learners
- Premium pricing that filters for serious participants
- Blockchain-verified credentials (Soul-Bound NFTs)
- Lifelong alumni community

### Our Standards

| Principle | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **The Ogilvy Standard** | Never talk down to our audience. Substance over sizzle. |
| **The Godin Permission** | Earn attention through value, never spam. |
| **The Buffett Filter** | Say no to almost everything. Focus relentlessly. |
| **The Jobs Vision** | Show people what's possible before they ask for it. |

Subject: Partnership Inquiry — EducatedTraveler Skill Adventures

Dear [Name],

I'm reaching out from EducatedTraveler, where we're building the global reference for certified skill adventures at the source.

We've identified [your program/location/expertise] as exactly the kind of world-class experience our learners are seeking. Our participants are 30-50 year old professionals who invest $3,500-$40,000 in genuine transformation—not tourists looking for a weekend activity.

What we offer partners:
• Qualified, committed students (8-12 per cohort)
• Full logistics and marketing—you just teach
• Long-term partnerships, not one-off transactions
• Premium compensation ($3,000-$8,000+ per cohort)
• Global visibility as a featured instructor/destination

I'd love to schedule a 30-minute call to explore whether there's alignment. We're selective about partnerships because our reputation depends on extraordinary quality.

Would [Date Option 1] or [Date Option 2] work for an initial conversation?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
Founder, EducatedTraveler

"One week to get certified. 6 months to change your life."
