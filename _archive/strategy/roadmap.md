## What's Missing

### Phase 1: Validate (Before Building Anything)

**The Goal:** Prove people will pay before you build.

| Priority | Task                                                                      | Status |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| 🔴       | **Launch survey** — Get 100+ responses to validate demand                 | ⬜      |
| 🔴       | **Build waitlist** — Simple landing page with email capture               | ⬜      |
| 🔴       | **10 customer interviews** — Talk to target users, understand pain points | ⬜      |
| 🟡       | **1 pilot partnership** — Get one cert body (PADI or YA) interested       | ⬜      |
| 🟡       | **1 instructor LOI** — Find one instructor willing to run first cohort    | ⬜      |

**Exit Criteria:** 50+ waitlist signups, 1 partnership conversation, validated pricing.

---

### Phase 2: Pilot (Minimum Viable Experience)

**The Goal:** Run ONE cohort manually before building tech.

| Priority | Task | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| 🔴 | **Pick first quest** — Bali Yoga 200hr is lowest risk | ⬜ |
| 🔴 | **Find accommodation** — Partner with 1 villa in Ubud | ⬜ |
| 🔴 | **Hire instructor** — Contract with certified E-RYT 500 | ⬜ |
| 🔴 | **Sell 8 spots** — Manual sales via email/calls | ⬜ |
| 🟡 | **Legal entity** — Form LLC, liability waivers, insurance | ⬜ |
| 🟡 | **Payment processing** — Stripe or similar for deposits | ⬜ |

**Exit Criteria:** First cohort booked and paid. You've proven unit economics work.

---

### Phase 3: Build (Only After Pilot Success)

**The Goal:** Build tech to scale what's already working.

| Priority | Task | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| 🔴 | **Website with booking** — Quest browsing, checkout, calendar | ⬜ |
| 🔴 | **CRM/operations** — Track cohorts, communications, logistics | ⬜ |
| 🟡 | **Community platform** — Pre-trip cohort formation (Slack/Discord) | ⬜ |
| 🟡 | **Content marketing** — Blog, social, testimonials from pilot | ⬜ |
| ⚪ | **Mobile app** — In-journey tracking (later) | ⬜ |
| ⚪ | **Blockchain** — NFT credentials (much later) | ⬜ |

---

### Phase 4: Scale

**The Goal:** Grow from 1 quest to 10, from 1 location to 5.

| Priority | Task | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| 🔴 | **Add 2-3 more quests** — Diving, sailing, wine | ⬜ |
| 🔴 | **Build instructor network** — 5-10 vetted instructors | ⬜ |
| 🔴 | **Formalize cert partnerships** — Official licensing | ⬜ |
| 🟡 | **Alumni program** — Reunions, advanced workshops | ⬜ |
| 🟡 | **Raise seed round** — $2M for growth | ⬜ |

## The Critical Path

```
Survey → Waitlist → First Booking → Pilot Cohort → Testimonials → Website → Scale
```

**Don't build until you've sold.**

---

## Immediate Next Actions

1. [ ] Deploy survey (Google Forms or Typeform)
2. [ ] Build landing page with waitlist (Carrd, Webflow, or simple HTML)
3. [ ] Post in 5 digital nomad communities to drive traffic
4. [ ] Email 10 potential customers for interviews
5. [ ] Research Bali yoga instructor rates and villa costs

## Key Risks to Watch

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| No demand at this price | Survey + pre-sales before building |
| Cert bodies won't partner | Start with one, prove quality first |
| Can't find quality instructors | Tap personal network, yoga/dive forums |
| High customer acquisition cost | Organic content, referrals, community |
| Operational complexity | Start with 1 location, 1 quest type |

*Keep it simple. Validate fast. Build slow.*
