## Done

### Agents Created
- `agents/Founder-CEO.md` — Vision guardian, first salesperson, mission drift filter
- `agents/HeadOfMarketing.md` — Brand voice, demand validation, community engagement
- `agents/HeadOfOperations.md` — A-I-O framework, flawless execution, vendor management
- `agents/DailyClose.md` — End-of-day ritual for GitHub + Linear workflow

### Roadmaps Created
- `agents/Founder-CEO-Roadmap.md` — 3 priorities: instructor, 10 calls, 8 deposits
- `agents/HeadOfMarketing-Roadmap.md` — 3 priorities: 100 surveys, 50 waitlist, instructor video
- `agents/HeadOfOperations-Roadmap.md` — 3 priorities: venue, 21-day schedule, vendors

### Instructor Outreach
- `website/instructors.html` — Partner landing page with application form
- `outreach/instructor-email-templates.md` — 5 email templates (warm, community-focused)
- `website/SETUP-FORMS.md` — Formspree setup guide

### Infrastructure
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` with development commands and accurate project structure

## Decisions Made
- **Agent structure**: Three core roles (CEO, Marketing, Ops) with clear mandates
- **A-I-O framework**: Adventure (40%), Immersion (35%), Optimization (25%)
- **Instructor tone**: Community partnership, not job posting
- **Form backend**: Formspree (simple, free, email delivery)
- **Task management**: Linear with minimal structure (Now/Next/Done only)
- **First principle**: "Don't build what you can't sell manually"

## Blockers / To Resolve
- [ ] Create Formspree account and get form ID for instructor page
- [ ] Set up Linear workspace with initial tasks
- [ ] Decide: Link instructor page from main landing page?

## Tomorrow / Next Session
1. Set up Formspree (5 min)
2. Set up Linear with initial pilot tasks
3. Begin instructor outreach — send first 5 emails
4. Check survey responses (if any)
5. Review waitlist signups
