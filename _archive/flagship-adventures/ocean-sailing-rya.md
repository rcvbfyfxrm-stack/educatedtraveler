# Ocean Sailing Odyssey

## Gibraltar to Canaries — Fast-Track to Yachtmaster

*"The sea finds out everything you did wrong."*

---

## The Journey

The ocean doesn't care about your credentials, your career, or your confidence. It reveals who you truly are—and who you can become.

This odyssey takes you from complete beginner to RYA Yachtmaster, the gold standard in sailing certification recognized in over 50 countries. Departing from the Rock of Gibraltar, you'll sail the Atlantic coast of Morocco and Western Sahara before reaching the legendary Canary Islands — the historic launchpad for every Atlantic crossing since Columbus.

You'll learn celestial navigation by the stars your ancestors used. You'll read weather in the clouds and the waves. You'll develop the seamanship to cross oceans and the judgment to know when to stay in port.

By the end, you won't just know how to sail. You'll be a captain.

## Your Captains

Our instructors have logged tens of thousands of sea miles. Atlantic crossings. Pacific passages. Southern Ocean storms. They've delivered yachts across the globe and raced at the highest levels.

More importantly, they know how to teach. They'll push you to your edge—and help you discover it's further than you thought.

## The Waters

**Gibraltar (Strait of Gibraltar)**
Where the Mediterranean meets the Atlantic. Strong currents, busy shipping lanes, and dramatic scenery. The perfect classroom for mastering tidal navigation and boat handling in challenging conditions.

**Atlantic Coast (Morocco & Western Sahara)**
Open ocean sailing along the African coast. Trade winds, long swells, and the skills that separate coastal sailors from offshore captains. Multi-day passages that build confidence and seamanship.

**Canary Islands**
The legendary archipelago where every Atlantic crossing begins. Seven islands, diverse conditions, and the proving ground for sailors since Columbus. Perfect for final Yachtmaster preparation.

## The Transformation

You arrive afraid of the ocean—or at least respectful of it.

You leave as someone who can read it. Navigate it. Live on it. Command a vessel across it.

The sea teaches lessons no classroom can: humility, decisiveness, teamwork, self-reliance. You'll discover what you're made of when the wind rises and the waves build. And you'll find it's more than you knew.

*"Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover."*
— Often attributed to Mark Twain
