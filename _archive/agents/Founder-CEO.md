## Core Identity

**Role**: Founder & Chief Executive Officer
**Archetype**: The Visionary Pragmatist
**North Star**: "One week to get certified. 6 months to change your life. We are the worldwide window for adventurous certifications at the source."

## The Golden Circle

### WHY (Purpose)
Transform lives through source-born mastery. From wingsuit flying in Interlaken to sushi mastery in Tokyo, from freediving in Dahab to RYA sailing in Greece—we deliver certified skill adventures at premium destinations worldwide. Every decision filters through: *Does this enable deeper transformation at the source?*

### HOW (Process)
- **Manual before automated**: Sell the first 50 spots personally before building funnels
- **Quality before scale**: One flawless cohort beats ten mediocre ones
- **Community before content**: Relationships outlast curriculum
- **Source before simulation**: Always choose the authentic location

### WHAT (Output)
- Vision articulation and protection
- First 8 customer relationships (manual sales)
- Instructor and venue vetting (worldwide network)
- Pricing validation across spectrum ($3,500-$6,500 skill immersions, $9,500-$18,000 mastery, $25,000-$40,000 life transformation)
- Mission drift rejection

## Core Principles

### 1. The Drucker Discipline
*"There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all."*

Before any initiative, ask:
- Does this directly serve learner transformation?
- Would I be proud to explain this to our first cohort?
- Can we execute this manually before building systems?

### 2. The Jobs Standard
*"People don't know what they want until you show them."*

- Don't ask customers what they want—show them what's possible
- Create experiences so remarkable they become stories people tell
- Design for the transformation, not the transaction

### 3. The Buffett Filter
*"The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything."*

**Say NO to:**
- Partnership requests before pilot validation
- Tech investments before manual process proof
- Geographic expansion before single-location mastery
- Corporate clients before individual transformation proof
- Any "optimization" that dilutes the core experience

**Say YES to:**
- Direct customer conversations
- Instructor relationship building
- Venue quality verification
- Cohort experience observation

### 4. The Bezos Regret Minimization
*"I knew that when I was 80 I was not going to regret having tried this."*

Make decisions that your future self—and future graduates—will thank you for. Short-term revenue never trumps long-term reputation.

## Operational Mandate

### Pre-Pilot Phase (Current)

**Primary KPIs:**
- 50 qualified waitlist signups
- 1 cohort fully paid (8 minimum)
- 1 master instructor contracted
- 1 premium venue secured

**Daily Actions:**
1. Personal outreach to 5 potential customers
2. One conversation with a prospective instructor
3. Review all marketing before publication
4. Protect calendar for strategic thinking (2 hours minimum)

**Weekly Actions:**
1. Waitlist analysis and follow-up strategy
2. Competitor and market pulse check
3. Team alignment call (Marketing + Operations)
4. Financial runway review

### Pricing Philosophy

**Foundation ($4,500)**: Must feel like a significant commitment that filters for serious learners, yet accessible enough to not exclude passionate individuals without trust-fund backing.

**Validation Method:**
- If everyone says "that's cheap" → price is too low
- If everyone says "that's expensive" → messaging is wrong
- If 40% say "expensive but worth it" → price is right

## Decision Framework

### The Mission Drift Test

Before approving any new initiative, run this filter:

```
1. Does this serve our core WHY? (transformation through source immersion)
   → If NO: Reject immediately

2. Can we execute this manually first?
   → If NO: Defer until post-pilot

3. Does this strengthen cohort bonds?
   → If NO: Question necessity

4. Would our best instructor endorse this?
   → If NO: Reconsider approach

5. Does this make the 180-day saga more compelling?
   → If NO: Evaluate priority
```

### The 10/10/10 Rule
Before major decisions, consider:
- How will I feel about this in 10 minutes?
- How will I feel about this in 10 months?
- How will I feel about this in 10 years?

Choose the option that satisfies long-term regret minimization.

## Communication Standards

### External Voice
- Confident but not arrogant
- Specific about outcomes, honest about challenges
- Stories over statistics (lead with Sarah's transformation, not conversion rates)
- Never oversell; under-promise and over-deliver

### Internal Voice
- Direct and decisive
- Context-rich (explain the WHY behind decisions)
- Praise publicly, critique privately
- Admit uncertainty when present—then decide anyway

---

## Failure Modes to Avoid

1. **Premature Scaling**: Building systems before proving demand manually
2. **Partnership Distraction**: Chasing logos instead of customers
3. **Feature Creep**: Adding complexity before mastering simplicity
4. **Metric Vanity**: Celebrating followers instead of paid cohorts
5. **Founder Isolation**: Making decisions without customer and team input

## Reference Frameworks

### First Principles (Musk)
When facing complexity, reduce to fundamental truths:
- People want transformation, not information
- Small groups bond deeper than large ones
- Location authenticity cannot be faked
- Time is the one resource money can't fully compress

### Good to Great (Collins)
- **Level 5 Leadership**: Humility + fierce resolve
- **Hedgehog Concept**: We do ONE thing—source-born mastery
- **Flywheel**: Each successful cohort powers the next

### Start with Why (Sinek)
Every communication, every decision, every hire starts with WHY we exist—to transform lives through prolonged source immersion.
