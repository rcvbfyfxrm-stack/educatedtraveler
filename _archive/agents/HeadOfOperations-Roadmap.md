## Priority 1: Secure the Perfect Bali Venue

1. Ask villa owner for recommendations
2. Check TripAdvisor for Bali private drivers
3. Request quotes from 3 providers
4. Test reliability with trial booking

**Contract Terms**:
- Daily rate for activity days
- Per-transfer rate for airport
- Emergency availability terms
- Fuel included or separate
- Cancellation policy

**Budget**:
| Service | Quantity | Rate | Total |
|---------|----------|------|-------|
| Airport transfers | 24 (12 in + 12 out) | $25-35 each | $600-840 |
| Activity transport | 4 days | $100-150/day | $400-600 |
| Emergency on-call | 21 days | $20/day retainer | $420 |
| **Total Transport** | | | **$1,420-1,860** |

### Meal Service

**Options**:
1. **Private chef**: Cook comes to villa daily
2. **Catering service**: Prepared meals delivered
3. **Hybrid**: Chef for some meals, restaurants for others
4. **Self-managed**: Participants cook together (less recommended)

**Recommended: Private Chef**

**Requirements**:
- Experience with retreat/group cooking
- Vegetarian expertise (most participants will be plant-based)
- Accommodation of allergies
- Clean, hygienic practices
- Ability to prep 3 meals + snacks daily

**Budget**:
| Service | Rate | Days | Total |

| Ingredients | $30-50/day | 21 | $630-1,050 |
| **Total Meals** | | | **$2,310-3,570** |

**Note**: If meals NOT included in participant fee, this becomes optional add-on or participant self-managed.

### Yoga Alliance Registration

**Process Research**:
1. Confirm instructor is registered school (RYS) holder or can register
2. Understand student registration process
3. Confirm exam/evaluation requirements
4. Document certificate delivery timeline
5. Establish backup plan if registration delayed

**Key Questions**:
- How long before cohort must school register?
- What documentation is required from participants?
- How are exams administered?
- What's the timeline for certificate delivery?
- What happens if a participant fails?

### Emergency Infrastructure

**Local Hospital**:
- Identify nearest international-standard hospital
- Confirm English-speaking staff availability
- Save address and phone in all materials
- Test route from venue (drive time)
- Verify insurance acceptance

**Emergency Contacts Document**:
| Role | Name | Phone | Notes |

## What NOT to Do

### Avoid These Traps

1. **Booking Before Verification**: Never sign a venue contract without virtual walkthrough or in-person visit

2. **Assuming Vendor Reliability**: Test all vendors with small bookings before committing

3. **Over-Scheduling**: The A-I-O framework requires 25% Optimization—don't fill every hour

4. **Ignoring Weather**: Bali has seasons. Plan for rain. Have indoor backups.

5. **Skipping Documentation**: "We'll figure it out" = chaos. Document everything before Day 1.

*"Transformation requires impeccable execution."*

*1 venue. 1 complete schedule. All vendors confirmed. Everything else is distraction.*
