## Part 1: Influencer Strategy

### Why Influencers?

Influencers provide:
- **Trust transfer** — Their audience trusts their recommendations
- **Content creation** — They document the experience for you
- **Social proof** — "If [influencer] did it, it must be legit"
- **Reach** — Access to your exact target audience

### Who to Target

| Tier | Followers | Value | Approach |
|------|-----------|-------|----------|
| **Nano** | 1K-10K | High engagement, niche authority, affordable | DM directly |
| **Micro** | 10K-100K | Strong trust, specific audiences, reasonable cost | DM or email |
| **Mid** | 100K-500K | Significant reach, still personal | Email + agent |
| **Macro** | 500K-1M+ | Mass reach, expensive, less personal | Agent/manager |

**Sweet Spot for EducatedTraveler: Micro-influencers (10K-100K)** in specific niches.

### Target Niches

|-------|-----|----------------------------|
| **Travel creators** | Overlap audience, adventure-seekers | Search: "travel blogger [destination]" |
| **Skill-specific** | Already interested in the craft | Sailing YouTubers, food bloggers, yoga teachers |
| **Lifestyle/self-improvement** | "Invest in yourself" audience | Life coaches, productivity creators |
| **Career changers** | People seeking transformation | "Quit my job" creators, digital nomads |
| **Luxury travel** | High-budget audience | Luxury hotel reviewers, first-class flyers |

### How to Find Them

   - Hashtags: #sailinglife #yogateacher #sushichef #travelblogger
   - Location tags: Tokyo, Rishikesh, Gibraltar
   - "Suggested" accounts from relevant profiles

2. **YouTube Search**

| **Long-term partnership** | Recurring cohorts, not one-off bookings |
| **Content creation** | Professional photos/video of their work |
| **International students** | Diverse cohorts, global reputation |

### What to Ask For in Return

| "I'm already full" | "Perfect. Let's plan for next season. Our students book 6+ months ahead." |
| "What if students aren't good?" | "We pre-qualify everyone. Portfolio review, video interview, commitment deposit. No tourists." |

## Part 3: Your Sales Pitch

> "We offer certified skill immersions at the source — learn sushi in Tokyo, sailing in the Atlantic, yoga in India — with real credentials, master instructors, and cohorts of 8-12 serious students."

### The Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

> "You know how people take cooking classes on vacation and forget everything in a week? We do the opposite. Month-long immersions with master instructors, at the source — Tokyo for sushi, Gibraltar for sailing, Rishikesh for yoga. You leave with real certifications and skills that last. We handle everything: logistics, accommodation, the instructors. You just show up ready to transform."

### The Full Pitch (2 minutes)

> "There's a gap in the market nobody's filled.
>
> On one side, you have online courses — 10% completion rate, no real credentials, no community.
>
> On the other side, traditional schools — 2-4 years, $50-100K, only for career changers.
>
> In the middle? Nothing. Until now.
>
> EducatedTraveler offers certified skill immersions at the source. One week to one month. $3,500 to $12,000. Real credentials from PADI, RYA, Yoga Alliance, WSET.
>
> Sushi mastery in Tokyo with an itamae who spent 10 years on rice alone. RYA sailing across the Atlantic — 3,000 miles, celestial navigation, the works. Yoga pilgrimage from Delhi to Dharamsala with RYT-200 certification.
>
> Small cohorts of 8-12 people. Pre-qualified students — no tourists. All logistics handled.
>
> What took me a decade of wandering, our students experience in weeks. We built the bridge.
>
> Skills last, tans fade."
