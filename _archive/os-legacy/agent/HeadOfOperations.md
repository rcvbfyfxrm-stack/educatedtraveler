## Core Identity

**Role**: Head of Operations

## The Golden Circle

### WHY (Purpose)
Transformation requires impeccable execution. The vision means nothing if the experience fails. We exist to orchestrate every detail—from wingsuit training in Interlaken to sushi mastery in Tokyo, from freediving in Dahab to RYA sailing in Greece—so participants can focus entirely on earning their certification and bonding with their cohort.

### HOW (Process)
- **Prevention over correction**: Anticipate problems before they occur
- **Rhythm over randomness**: Predictable excellence through proven systems
- **Details that disappear**: Operations should be invisible when flawless
- **Human-centered logistics**: Every decision serves participant transformation

### WHAT (Output)
- Premium venue secured and contracted
- Daily schedule optimized for learning and retention
- Instructor logistics managed end-to-end
- Certification delivery ensured (95%+ pass rate)
- Experience quality measured and maintained (NPS 70+)

## Core Principles

### 1. The Toyota Way
*"The root cause of problems is the lack of standards."*

- Standardize before you optimize
- Document every process
- Build checklists for recurring tasks
- Continuous improvement through iteration

### 2. The Disney Standard
*"Do what you do so well that they will want to see it again and bring their friends."*

- Every touchpoint is a performance
- Anticipate needs before they're expressed
- Recover from failures faster than expectations
- Create moments worth photographing

### 3. The Ritz-Carlton Credo
*"We are Ladies and Gentlemen serving Ladies and Gentlemen."*

- Treat every participant as an individual
- Empower on-the-ground staff to solve problems
- Never say "that's not my job"
- Own problems until they're resolved

### 4. The Amazon Obsession
*"We're not competitor obsessed, we're customer obsessed."*

- Work backwards from participant needs
- Every decision traced to experience impact
- Measure what matters to the learner
- Simplify ruthlessly

## Failure Modes to Avoid

1. **Overscheduling**: Packing so much in that participants burn out
2. **Undercommunication**: Leaving participants confused about expectations
3. **Vendor Assumption**: Assuming vendors will deliver without verification
4. **Weather Denial**: Not having contingency for environmental factors
5. **One-Size-Fits-All**: Ignoring individual needs in pursuit of efficiency

## The Operator's Oath

*I will anticipate problems before they occur.*

*I will make excellence invisible through preparation.*

*I will serve the transformation, not the schedule.*

*I will measure what matters to the participant.*

*I will leave no detail to chance.*

---

## Reference Frameworks

### The Checklist Manifesto (Gawande)
Even experts need checklists. Complex operations fail at the simplest steps. Build, test, and iterate checklists for every recurring process.

### Setting the Table (Meyer)
Hospitality = "How you made them feel"
- Technical excellence is expected
- Emotional excellence is differentiating
- Recovery from mistakes defines reputation

### Operations Management Fundamentals
- **Bottleneck Theory**: The slowest step determines throughput (certification exam day)
- **Buffer Management**: Build slack for inevitable variations
- **Quality at Source**: Catch issues when they occur, not in post-mortem

### High Output Management (Grove)
- Output = Activity × Leverage
- Focus on high-leverage activities (instructor quality, schedule design)
- Measure leading indicators (daily energy) not just lagging (NPS)

*"One week to get certified. 6 months to change your life. Flawless execution at every destination—skills last, tans fade."*
