# The EducatedTraveler Cohort Promise

What every learner can expect when they join an EducatedTraveler cohort.

## What We Promise You

### 1. Serious Training, Not Tourism

- You will **know everyone by name** and share real struggle together.

### 3. Masters at the Source
- You learn from **certified instructors** with **5+ years experience**.
- Your teachers have dedicated their lives to this craft.

### 4. Real Rest, Real Integration
- No sitting blocks longer than **90 minutes**.
- At least **1 rest day per week** to recover, integrate, and breathe.

### 5. Honest Standards
- Certifications are **earned**, never bought.
- If you’re not ready, we will tell you—and help you get there.

### 6. Respect for Place & People
- We treat the local environment and community with respect.
- You will be guided to engage as a **guest and learner**, not a tourist.

- Be honest about your limits; we’ll help you grow from there.
