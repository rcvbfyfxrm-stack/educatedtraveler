# Tokyo Instructor Call Prep

## ABOUT ME (Your Story)

**The beginning:**
- At 18, I finished high school. Everyone expected university, the usual path.
- I kept asking: "Is this the life I actually want to live?"
- I didn't want to watch simulations of the world — I wanted to live it.
- So I decided to find out.

**What I've done:**
- **Culinary**: Michelin kitchens in France. Street vendors in Bangkok. WSET certified in Paris. Private chef on some of the world's finest yachts.
- **Sailing**: 50,000+ nautical miles. RYA certified in Thailand. Regattas in Sydney. Sailboat deliveries worldwide.
- **Adventure**: Molchanov freediving in Mexico. Shark diving in the Galápagos. Annapurna Base Camp at 4,130m.
- **Wellness**: Breathwork training in Bali. Ayurvedic medicine in India.

**Why I built EducatedTraveler:**
- Every skill I learned changed my life — not just the skill itself, but the masters who taught me and the people I learned alongside.
- Most people don't know how to access these experiences. They don't know the right instructors, the right places, or how to structure it.
- I want to give others the same path I had — real skills, real credentials, real transformation.
- "One week to get certified. 6 months to change your life."
