## Your Story (60 seconds — only if they ask)

> "At 18, I finished school in France and asked myself: what if I just went? So I did. Over the next decade, I sailed 50,000 miles across every ocean, cooked in Michelin kitchens and Bangkok street stalls, got my RYA in Thailand, my WSET in Paris, freedived in Indonesia, summited Annapurna Base Camp. Every skill I learned came the same way — a place, a person, total immersion. Now I want to give others that same path. What took me a decade, they can experience in weeks."

**Keep it short. This is about them, not you.**
