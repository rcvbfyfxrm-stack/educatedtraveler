# EducatedTraveler Pitch

## The One-Liner

**Certified skill immersions at premium destinations worldwide.**

*"One week to get certified. 6 months to change your life."*

---

## The Problem

People are stuck. They watch YouTube tutorials. Take online courses. Read books. But they still can't actually DO the thing.

Because:
- Screens can't teach your hands
- Videos can't correct your grip
- Algorithms can't sense when you're ready for the next level

Every day not training with a real master is a day falling behind.

---

## The Solution

**EducatedTraveler puts you in the room.**

The kitchen. The boat. The studio. The dojo.

With masters who've spent decades perfecting their craft. Small cohorts (8-12 people) who become lifelong friends. Real certifications from real bodies.

## The Founder

At 18, Arnaud got his Bac in science and asked: *what if I just went?*

What followed:
- **50,000+ nautical miles** across every ocean
- **Michelin kitchens** in France to street vendors in Bangkok
- **RYA certified** in Thailand, then real-world passages
- **WSET certified** in Paris, cycling through French vineyards
- **Freediving** in Indonesia — presence from the depths
- **Annapurna Base Camp** — Himalayan humility
- **Shark diving in the Galápagos** — fear transformed to respect

Every skill came the same way: **A place. A person. Total immersion.**

> "What took me a decade, you can experience in weeks. Your adventure is waiting."
