# Sacred Yoga Pilgrimage

## Following the Ganges — From Delhi to Dharamsala

*"You do not do yoga. You become yoga."*

---

## The Journey

This is not a yoga retreat. It is a pilgrimage.

You will follow the sacred Ganges from the chaos of Delhi through the yoga capital of the world in Rishikesh to the Himalayan sanctuary of Dharamsala—home of His Holiness the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government in exile.

Along the way, you will practice where yoga was born. Study with lineage holders who carry teachings passed down for generations. Witness the Ganga Aarti at sunset. Meditate in caves where sages achieved enlightenment. And potentially receive a blessing from one of the most revered spiritual leaders on Earth.

You will return home certified to teach. But more importantly, you will return transformed.

## The Transformation

You arrive as someone who does yoga.

You leave as someone who lives yoga.

The practices become part of your breath, your movement, your way of seeing the world. You carry within you the energy of the Ganges, the wisdom of the Himalayas, and the blessing of a tradition that has guided seekers for five thousand years.

And you carry credentials that allow you to share this gift with others.
