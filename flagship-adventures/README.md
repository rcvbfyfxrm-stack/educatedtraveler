## Why These Three?

**Sushi Mastery** — The ultimate culinary discipline. Years of apprenticeship compressed into an intensive month with masters who've dedicated their lives to the craft. You don't just learn technique; you absorb a philosophy of precision, patience, and reverence for ingredients.

**Sacred Yoga Pilgrimage** — Follow the Ganges from Delhi through Rishikesh to Dharamsala. Practice where yoga was born, study with lineage holders, and potentially meet His Holiness the Dalai Lama. This isn't a retreat; it's a pilgrimage that transforms how you move, breathe, and live.

**Ocean Sailing Odyssey** — The sea doesn't care about your resume. Learn celestial navigation, weather systems, and seamanship from captains who've crossed oceans. Emerge with globally-recognized RYA credentials and the confidence to skipper anywhere on Earth.
