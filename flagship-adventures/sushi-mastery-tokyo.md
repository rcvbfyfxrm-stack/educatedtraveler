# Sushi Mastery Tokyo

## The Art of Edomae — One Month to Transform Your Hands

*"Ten years to master rice. A lifetime to perfect the cut."*

---

## The Journey

In Japan, sushi is not food—it is philosophy made edible. Every grain of rice carries 400 years of tradition. Every slice of fish reflects decades of relationship between chef and supplier. Every piece placed before a guest is a meditation on seasonality, respect, and impermanence.

For one month, you will live this philosophy.

Not as a tourist watching through glass. Not as a student in a classroom. As an apprentice standing where masters have stood for generations—behind the counter of a working sushiya in Tokyo.

## The Transformation

You leave understanding it as something you practice.

The knife becomes an extension of your hand. The rice speaks to your fingertips. The fish reveals its secrets. And you carry within you a tradition that spans centuries—ready to honor it wherever you go.
