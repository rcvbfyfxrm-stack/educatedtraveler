## Priority 1: Drive 100 Survey Responses

**Why This Matters**: The survey validates that the target persona (30-50, $100k+, seeking transformation) actually exists AND wants what we're building. Without data, we're guessing.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] 100 completed survey responses
- [ ] 60%+ match target demographic (age 30-50, income $100k+)
- [ ] 40%+ say "extremely" or "very interested"
- [ ] Top 3 journey preferences identified
- [ ] Pricing acceptance validated

### Distribution Strategy

**Channel 1: Digital Nomad Communities (40 responses target)**

| Community | Approach | Expected Responses |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Nomad List Slack | Genuine post in #general or #offtopic | 10-15 |
| r/digitalnomad | Value-first post with survey ask | 8-12 |
| Remote Work Slack groups | Share survey in relevant channels | 5-8 |
| Hacker Paradise alumni | Direct outreach if accessible | 5-10 |
| WiFi Tribe community | Post if membership allows | 5-8 |

**Sample Post (not spam)**:
> I'm researching whether there's demand for extended skill-based travel (think: earn your yoga certification in Bali over 21 days, or PADI divemaster in Thailand over 45 days).
>
> Not selling anything—genuinely trying to understand if people would do this. Would love 5 min of your time: [survey link]
>
> Happy to share findings with the community when we have 100+ responses.

**Channel 2: Sabbatical & Career Pivot Groups (30 responses target)**

| Community | Approach | Expected Responses |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| r/sabbatical | Post about research | 8-10 |
| Career pivot Facebook groups | Value-first sharing | 10-15 |
| LinkedIn (personal network) | Direct messages to connections | 5-10 |
| Medium/Substack comments | Engage on sabbatical content | 3-5 |

**Channel 3: Wellness & Personal Development (20 responses target)**

| Community | Approach | Expected Responses |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Yoga teacher Facebook groups | Ask about YTT demand | 8-12 |
| Wellness entrepreneur groups | Career pivot angle | 5-8 |
| Mindfulness communities | Transformation narrative | 3-5 |

**Channel 4: Direct Outreach (10 responses target)**

| Source | Approach | Expected Responses |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| Personal network | Email friends who match profile | 5-8 |
| LinkedIn 2nd connections | Request intros | 3-5 |
| Survey respondent referrals | "Know anyone else?" | 2-3 |

### Weekly Action Plan

**Week 1: Launch**
- [ ] Post in 3 nomad communities

## Priority 2: Build 50 Qualified Waitlist Signups

**Why This Matters**: Survey responses show interest. Waitlist signups show intent. 50 qualified leads gives CEO a pool to convert to 8 paid deposits.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] 50 waitlist signups
- [ ] 70%+ match target demographic
- [ ] Email open rate 15%+
- [ ] At least 20 respond to follow-up email

### Conversion Path

```
Survey Completion → Thank You Page with Waitlist CTA → Email Confirmation → Nurture Sequence
```

**Current Setup**: Landing page links to Google Form survey, which should end with waitlist option (Question 30: "Would you like us to contact you when we launch?")

### Waitlist Optimization

**Landing Page Improvements**
1. Add urgency: "First cohort: Spring 2026 | Limited to 12 spots"
2. Add social proof section (when available): instructor credentials
3. Ensure mobile experience is flawless
4. Test button copy variations

**Post-Survey Capture**
1. Google Form thank you message should include:
   > "Thanks for your input! You're now on our early access list. We'll reach out before we open bookings publicly."

2. Export emails weekly and add to email list

### Email Nurture Sequence

**Email 1: Welcome (Day 0)**
Subject: "You're in—here's what's coming"

> Thanks for taking our survey. Your input is shaping what we build.
>
> Quick update: We're launching our first cohort in [season] 2026. It's a 21-day Yoga Alliance 200hr certification in Bali, limited to 12 people.
>
> As an early supporter, you'll get:
> - First access to booking (before public launch)
> - Founding member pricing
> - Direct line to the founder
>
> Stay tuned. We'll be in touch soon with instructor details and exact dates.
>
> — [Founder name]

**Email 2: Instructor Tease (Day 7)**
Subject: "Meet your instructor"

> We just signed our master instructor for the Bali pilot.
>
> [Brief bio + photo + one credential highlight]
>
> [Link to instructor intro video when ready]
>
> Spots are going to go fast. Reply to this email if you want to be first in line when we open booking.

**Email 3: Behind the Scenes (Day 14)**
Subject: "Where you'll stay"

> [Photo of venue or Bali location]
>
> We're finalizing the villa for our first cohort. Here's a peek.
>
> [1-2 sentences about location, features]
>
> Still interested? Hit reply and let me know what questions you have.

**Email 4: Soft Open (Day 21)**
Subject: "8 spots. First come, first served."

> We're opening booking for our pilot cohort. 8-12 spots, $4,500 all-in (except meals).
>
> Dates: [specific dates]
>
> Reply to this email to reserve your spot. I'll send payment details directly.
>
> — [Founder name]

## Priority 3: Create Instructor Credibility Content

**Why This Matters**: The instructor IS the product. Prospective customers need to see, hear, and trust the person who will guide their transformation. Text credentials don't create trust—video does.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] 2-3 minute instructor intro video live
- [ ] Instructor bio page on landing site
- [ ] 5+ views per qualified lead
- [ ] Positive feedback from early viewers

### Content Production Plan

**Phase 1: Capture (Once Instructor Signed)**

| Content | Format | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Instructor intro | 2-3 min video | Build trust, show personality |
| Teaching clips | 30-60 sec videos | Demonstrate expertise |
| Testimonials | Text + photo | Third-party validation |
| Credentials visual | Designed graphic | Authority building |

**Instructor Intro Video Script Framework**:

1. **Hook (10 sec)**: "Hi, I'm [Name], and I've guided over [X] people through their yoga teacher transformation."

2. **Credibility (30 sec)**: "I've been teaching for [X] years, trained in [locations], and hold [credentials]. But what I love most is watching someone go from nervous beginner to confident teacher."

3. **Philosophy (45 sec)**: "My approach is [unique methodology]. I believe transformation happens when [core principle]. That's why I'm excited to partner with EducatedTraveler—they understand that mastery requires time, place, and community."

4. **Invitation (30 sec)**: "If you're ready to not just learn yoga, but become a teacher, I'd love to guide you through this journey in Bali. It's 21 days that will change how you see yourself."

5. **Close (10 sec)**: "I hope to practice with you soon."

**Phase 2: Distribution**

| Channel | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Landing page | Embed video in "About" or "Instructor" section |
| Email sequence | Include in Email 2 |
| Social | Post teaser clips |
| Survey thank you | Link to video |

**Phase 3: Amplification**

- Ask instructor to share with their network
- Cross-post to yoga communities (where appropriate)
- Include in all sales conversations

## What NOT to Do

### Avoid These Traps

1. **Vanity Metrics**: Followers, likes, and shares mean nothing without survey responses and waitlist signups

2. **Premature Polish**: Don't redesign the landing page or create elaborate graphics before validating demand

3. **Broad Targeting**: Stay focused on the "Conscious Achiever" (30-50, $100k+). Resist temptation to "expand the audience"

4. **Spam Mentality**: Every community post must provide value first. Never drop links without context

5. **Automation Before Understanding**: Don't build email funnels until you know what language resonates
