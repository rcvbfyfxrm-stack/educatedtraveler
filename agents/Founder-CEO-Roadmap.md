## Priority 1: Sign One Master Instructor

**Why This First**: The instructor IS the product. A mediocre venue with a legendary instructor creates magic. A luxury villa with a weak instructor creates refunds.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] E-RYT 500 certification (5+ years teaching)
- [ ] Experience with intensive teacher trainings (minimum 3 cohorts led)
- [ ] Available for 23 days (21 + 2 buffer)
- [ ] Willing to be filmed for marketing
- [ ] References verified
- [ ] Agreement signed with terms

### Action Steps

**Week 1: Research & Outreach**
1. Search Yoga Alliance directory for E-RYT 500 teachers in Bali
2. Check Instagram for Ubud-based yoga influencers with teaching credentials
3. Post in yoga teacher Facebook groups: "Seeking master instructor for premium TTC"
4. Email 10 instructors with partner brief
5. Ask personal network for warm introductions

**Week 2: Conversations**
1. Schedule video calls with 3-5 qualified candidates
2. Use this script:
   > "We're building EducatedTraveler—premium immersive education for professionals. We're looking for a master instructor to lead our first 21-day Yoga Alliance 200hr cohort in Bali. This isn't a budget training; we're charging $4,500 and attracting committed learners. We want someone who can deliver a transformational experience, not just check certification boxes."

3. Ask key questions:
   - What makes your teaching approach unique?
   - Describe your ideal student
   - What's the biggest mistake most TTCs make?
   - What would you need to deliver a world-class experience?

**Week 3: Selection & Terms**
1. Check references (call 2-3 past TTC students)
2. Negotiate terms:
   - Base fee: $3,000-5,000 for 21 days
   - Per-student bonus: $200-300/student
   - Travel + accommodation covered
   - Marketing rights (video, testimonials)
3. Draft simple agreement (not full contract yet)

**Week 4: Secure Commitment**
1. Get signed Letter of Intent
2. Agree on pilot cohort dates
3. Begin content creation (instructor intro video)

### Red Flags to Avoid
- Instructors who focus on their following, not their teaching
- Anyone who can't explain their methodology clearly
- Teachers who haven't led full 200hr trainings
- Unwillingness to be filmed or featured

## Priority 2: 10 Real Customer Conversations

**Why This Matters**: Survey responses show interest. Conversations reveal intent. You need to hear objections, understand hesitation, and validate that people will actually pay—not just click "interested."

### Success Criteria
- [ ] 10 completed 20-30 minute calls
- [ ] Participants match target persona (30-50, $100k+, interested in transformation)
- [ ] Pricing reaction documented for each
- [ ] Top 3 objections identified
- [ ] 3+ say "I would book this"

### The Conversation Framework

**Opening (2 min)**
> "Thanks for taking the time. I'm building something new—extended immersion education where professionals earn real certifications at the source. I'm not selling anything today; I just want to understand if this resonates and what would make it compelling enough to book."

**Understanding (10 min)**
1. "What's the last skill-based travel experience you've done?"
2. "What was missing from it?"
3. "Have you ever considered taking extended time off to learn something deeply?"
4. "What stopped you?"

**Concept Introduction (5 min)**
> "Here's what we're building: A 21-day Yoga Alliance 200hr certification in Bali. You'd arrive as part of a small cohort of 8-12 professionals. By the end, you have an internationally recognized teaching credential, lifelong connections, and a transformed identity. Price is $4,500 all-in except meals."

**Reaction Capture (10 min)**
1. "What's your gut reaction to that?"
2. "At $4,500, does that feel too high, about right, or surprisingly low?"
3. "What would need to be true for you to actually book this?"
4. "What concerns come to mind immediately?"

**Closing (3 min)**
> "This has been incredibly helpful. We're launching our first cohort in [timeframe]. Would you want me to reach out when spots open?"

### Where to Find Interviewees
1. Survey respondents who left email
2. LinkedIn connections in target demographic
3. Nomad List members
4. Sabbatical planning groups
5. Friends-of-friends who match profile

### Documentation Template

| Name | Date | Age/Income | Key Insight | Price Reaction | Would Book? | Top Objection |
|------|------|------------|-------------|----------------|-------------|---------------|
| | | | | | | |

## Priority 3: Secure 8 Paid Deposits

**Why 8**: Minimum viable cohort. Below 8, community dynamics suffer. Above 12, intimacy fades. 8 paid proves the model works.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] 8 paid deposits ($500-1,000 each)
- [ ] Deposits refundable until 60 days before
- [ ] Clear terms communicated
- [ ] Cohort dates announced
- [ ] Waitlist converted to buyers

### The Sales Process

**Phase 1: Warm Leads (from survey + conversations)**
1. Email everyone who said "extremely interested" or "very interested"
2. Subject: "You said you were interested in [specific program they indicated]"
3. Body:
   > "You took our survey and said you'd seriously consider a 21-day Yoga certification in Bali. We're launching our pilot cohort in [dates]. Only 8-12 spots. Would you want to be on the shortlist for early booking?"

4. Goal: Get 20 people to say yes to being on shortlist

**Phase 2: Qualification Calls**
1. Schedule 15-minute calls with shortlist
2. Confirm fit:
   - Can they take 21 days off?
   - Is $4,500 within budget?
   - Are they serious or just curious?
3. Address objections directly
4. Goal: Identify 12-15 serious candidates

**Phase 3: Deposit Request**
1. Create simple booking page (Stripe checkout)
2. Email qualified candidates:
   > "We're opening 8 spots for our pilot cohort. Deposit is $1,000 (fully refundable until 60 days before). First 8 confirmed deposits lock in founder pricing and early bird rates. Reply to reserve your spot."

3. Follow up personally with anyone who hesitates
4. Goal: Close 8

### Pricing Validation During Sales
Track every reaction:
- "That's expensive" → Record objection details
- "That's about what I expected" → Green light
- "That's actually less than I thought" → Consider price increase
- "I need to think about it" → What specifically needs thinking?

**40% saying "expensive but worth it" = price is right**

## Decision Framework: What to Say NO To

During this phase, you will be tempted by distractions. Use this filter:

### Reject Immediately
- "Let's build an app before we have customers"
- "We should get more followers on Instagram"
- "Let's wait until the website is perfect"
- "We need a partnership with [big brand] first"
- "Let's add more features to the prototype"

### Defer Until Post-Pilot
- Blockchain credentials
- Mobile app
- Multiple destinations
- Advanced booking system
- Corporate partnerships

### Accept Only
- Direct customer conversations
- Instructor relationship building
- Venue research (for Operations)
- Manual sales activities
- Content that features the instructor
